    "title": "Eva Ballin, Attorney in Nice",
    "description1": "Eva Ballin is an attorney at the Nice Bar. She practices primarily in criminal law and white-collar crime, where law meets real life, its tensions, its urgencies, its risks. For her, criminal procedure is not just a framework: it is a field of precision, where every word counts, where every mistake can be costly, and where every irregularity must be identified, discussed, and challenged.",
    "description2": "Trained for two years at the Institut de Sciences pénales d'Aix-en-Provence (graduated with honors), she holds two Masters degrees in business law and financial crime, as well as a DESU in economic criminal risk. She enriched this background with experience in compliance and anti-money laundering at a Big Four firm in Luxembourg, before joining a white-collar crime law firm in Monaco. Trained by Maître Joseph Cohen Sabban, Maîtres Steeve Ruben and Marie Violleau in Paris, then by Maître Sophie Jonquet in Nice.",
    "quote": "\"Courage, for a lawyer, is essential, without which nothing else matters: talent, culture, knowledge of the law, everything is useful to a lawyer. But without courage, at the decisive moment, there are only words, sentences that follow one another, that shine and die.\"",
